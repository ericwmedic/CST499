UAGC CST499 Final Project
Student Registration website created for University of Arizona Global Campus CST499 final project. 
This website relies on an SQL database called "college_registration" with three tables:
tbluser - contains student information like email address, password, name, address, and enrollment
courses - contains course information like name, course number, ID, and available seats
registrations - links tbluser (email) to courses (courseID) and waitlist to track courses that the student has enrolled in

This information is publically available for research, education, and reference purposes. 

Thanks!
